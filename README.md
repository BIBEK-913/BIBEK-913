Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my skills in the C programming language and sharing my solutions to problems from LeetCode and other sites in my repository BIBEK-913-Leetcode-Solutions-and-Random-Problems.

ðŸŒ± I'm always looking to learn and improve as a developer.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ¤” If you need help with anything, feel free to reach out to me.

ðŸ’¬ You can contact me via GitHub or email at bibekpoudel442@gmail.com.

ðŸ“« My pronouns are he/him.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a connoisseur of Japanese animation and graphic novels. My current obsession is the thrilling post-apocalyptic series "Attack on Titan."

Thanks for stopping by!
